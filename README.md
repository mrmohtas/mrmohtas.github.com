# Description

Even though this update is a fundemental rewrite of the original code base of the site it still uses the v2.0-2.0 design so instead of a version this is a reworking and feature rich iteration of the same version.

This update applies the site to the Jekyll static site generator and utilises the Liquid templatng engine to streamline and help with future upgrades.

The big additions to the front-end of the site are the posts and demos features, allow me to being publishing articles and demonstrate my experiments and ideas.
