This update has been coming for a long time, I've been talking about going over my site for a while. The aim is to add this very feature, the ability to start writing articles and beginning to try my hand at doing it in some professional capcity.

The platform I've chosen to provide this update is [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/ "Jekyll"), which is a static site generator that uses the [Liquid](https://github.com/Shopify/liquid "Liquid") templating engine. It was fun learning how to use these technologies and isn't that the point of what we do as developers? To have fun and challenge ourselves, especially in our side projects.

## What is update means

The big features of this update is to make future updates a lot easier and give myself more space to experiment and talk about my understanding of the industry.

Here's a run down of the main changes to the site:

* Optimisation of the base code (HTML/SASS)
* Tweak of the background colours to increase contrast and readability
* Removal of some JS bloat
* Added post areas for articles and demos
* Added recent posts/demos widget for the front page
